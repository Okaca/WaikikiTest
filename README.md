This repository contains the JavaScript code to build a product page for the LC Waikiki product page, similar to the carousel visible on the websiteâ€™s product pages.
It dynamically displays products fetched from an external JSON file, and includes interactive features such as favorites, smooth sliding functionality, and responsiveness across multiple devices.

***USAGE***

Install the script and execute it within the Inspect Console of your browser.

Additional Notes

    The code did not use jquery, but vanilla javascript, however there is an example function for how jquery would be used.
    This script only works on any web page since it is written in vanilla javascript.
    When the screen layout changes, the functionality of the 'prev' and 'next' buttons may not work correctly, 
    and the code should be re-executed. Since the proportions are dynamic, the screen size is measured when the code is initially executed. 
    Therefore, in order for the buttons to function properly, refreshing the page might be necessary.
